Hello! If you're reading this, welcome to my "voice" Text Adventure Mini-game called NIGHTMARE!
Credits to all sounds and references used are in the first tab of code and this very file you're
reading right now (opened in Processing)!

Known Bugs:
When you start the game, MAKE SURE TO CLICK ANYWHERE ON THE SCREEN THAT POPS UP, as for some reason
the game doesn't register otherwise that the window is actually open if you don't do that - meaning
that any inputs entered will not work.

Additionally, the game might tend to lag for just a short second when you select the 'Quit' option.
This is probably due to the atrocious amount of .wav files I used for this, but don't worry! It only 
takes 2 - 3 more seconds to close rather than just closing instantly, which isn't too big of a deal.

Other than that, good luck and have fun finding all the endings! I had a ton of fun story-building
for this lol. Tell me what you think could be improved in the school discord, or if anything ends up
not working, if you'd like!
