Hello! If you're reading this, welcome to my "voice" Text Adventure Mini-game called NIGHTMARE!
Credits to all sounds and references used are in the first tab of code (opened in Processing).

Known Bugs:
When you start the game, MAKE SURE TO CLICK ANYWHERE ON THE SCREEN THAT POPS UP, as for some reason
the game doesn't register otherwise that the window is actually open if you don't do that - meaning
that any inputs entered will not work.

Other than that, good luck and have fun finding all the endings! I had a ton of fun story-building
for this lol. Tell me what you think could be improved in the school discord, or if anything ends up
not working, if you'd like!
